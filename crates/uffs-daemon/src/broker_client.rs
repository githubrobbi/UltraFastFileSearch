//! Daemon-side broker client (D7.7).
//!
//! When running on Windows, the daemon can optionally use the Access Broker
//! to obtain elevated volume handles instead of requiring its own elevation.
//!
//! Flow:
//! 1. Check if the broker pipe exists (`uffs_broker_protocol::PIPE_NAME`)
//! 2. Connect to it
//! 3. Encode the drive letter via `uffs_broker_protocol::HandleRequest::encode`
//! 4. Decode the response via `uffs_broker_protocol::HandleResponse::parse`
//! 5. Use the handle for MFT reading
//!
//! The wire format used to be duplicated here as a `const BROKER_PIPE_NAME`
//! plus hand-rolled byte-slicing with a `// must match
//! uffs-broker/src/broker.rs` reviewer-comment as the only protection
//! against drift.  F5 (issue #205) promoted those shared symbols to
//! the dedicated `uffs_broker_protocol` crate, eliminating the
//! textual coupling.
//!
//! `uffs-broker-protocol` is scoped to
//! `[target.'cfg(windows)'.dependencies]` in `Cargo.toml`, so it isn't
//! an extern crate at all on non-Windows targets — no `use … as _;`
//! marker is needed.

// NOTE: there is intentionally no `broker_available()` probe.  A
// `GetFileAttributesW` existence check on the pipe *connects to* the broker's
// single instance and leaves it busy, starving the real handle request with
// ERROR_PIPE_BUSY (2026-06-13 VM finding).  Broker presence is established
// solely by `request_volume_handle` attempting the connection.

/// Request a volume handle from the broker for a drive letter.
///
/// Returns the raw handle value (as a `u64`) that can be used for MFT reading.
/// The handle is already duplicated into our process by the broker.

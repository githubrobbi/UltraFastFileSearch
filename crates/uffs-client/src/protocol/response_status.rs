//! Daemon-state wire types: `drives`, `status`, and `stats` RPC responses.
//!
//! Split out of [`super::response`] so the search/payload subset of the
//! protocol surface stays under the workspace 800-LOC policy ceiling
//! without a file-size exemption.  Functionally these types form one
//! cohesive group — they describe the *daemon's own state* (loaded
//! drives, runtime telemetry, lifecycle phase, perf counters) — as
//! opposed to query results, which live alongside `SearchResponse` in
//! `response.rs`.
//!
//! The original module re-exports each type via `pub use`, so external
//! callers continue to import from `uffs_client::protocol::response::*`
//! exactly as before — the split is internal layout, not a breaking
//! change to the public protocol surface.

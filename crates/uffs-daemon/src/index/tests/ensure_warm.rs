//! Covers:
//!
//! * Phase 3 Commit C — fast path (no Parked/Cold), filter skipping,
//!   `BodyLoader` injection (success / missing / panicking).
//! * Phase 5 (#93) — parallel re-promote contract via `SlowBodyLoader` (peak
//!   in-flight ≥ 2, wall ≈ delay not N×delay).
//! * Phase 4 task 4.11 promote-side bloom pre-check (miss case keeps Parked,
//!   hit case promotes).
//! * PR-e — single-flight dedup contract via `CountingBodyLoader` (N=10
//!   concurrent `ensure_warm` callers ⇒ exactly 1 `BodyLoader::load` call; slot
//!   clears after the cleanup task drains so re-promote loads fresh; failures
//!   propagate uniformly to all waiters).
//!
//! `FixedBodyLoader` is shared with `super::lifecycle_hooks` and
//! [`super::idle_demote`] and lives in `super` (`mod.rs`).  The
//! other loader fakes (`MissingBodyLoader`, `PanickingBodyLoader`,
//! `SlowBodyLoader`, `CountingBodyLoader`) and the
//! `wait_for_in_flight_clear` PR-e polling helper live in the
//! sibling [`super::body_loader_fakes`] module.

// for the same Parked drive onto a SINGLE
// `BodyLoader::load` invocation.  Backstory:
//
// On Windows v0.5.83, the MCP-validation soak with 25 concurrent
// connections drove transient RSS to ~36 GB (stable working set
// ~756 MB → ~36 148 MB peak → settle ~3 991 MB) because every
// search dispatch independently observed the Parked drives and
// each spawned its own decompress task — see `LOG/windos 0.5.83`
// and `docs/refactor/promote-thundering-herd-fix.md`.
//
// The fix is a per-letter
// [`futures::future::Shared`] over the body-load future, installed
// in `IndexManager::in_flight_promotes` on first arrival.  These
// three tests pin the contract:
//
// 1. `dedupes_concurrent_promotes_for_same_letter` — N=10 concurrent callers ⇒
//    exactly 1 `BodyLoader::load` call.
// 2. `slot_clears_after_completion` — re-demote + re-promote ⇒ a fresh load
//    fires (no stale `Shared` reuse).
// 3. `failure_propagates_to_all_waiters` — failed load ⇒ all 5 callers see the
//    failure, slot cleared, exactly 1 load attempt.

/// Headline PR-e contract: with N=10 concurrent search
/// dispatches all targeting the same Parked drive, the

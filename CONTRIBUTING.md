## Platform and privilege model

- UFFS is Windows-first: live NTFS MFT reads require Windows and Administrator privileges.
- macOS and Linux remain valid contributor hosts for docs work, offline/query logic, and cross-platform tests.
- Keep Windows-only I/O behind `#[cfg(windows)]` and prefer cross-platform validation when possible.

## Toolchain and setup

- Use the pinned nightly toolchain from `rust-toolchain.toml`.
- `just` is the primary workflow entry point.

Recommended setup:

1. Install the nightly toolchain: `rustup toolchain install nightly`
2. Install `just`: `cargo install just`
3. Install the common contributor toolchain: `just setup`
4. List available workflows any time with `just`

### Toolchain policy

The workspace has **no MSRV claim** — it is structurally nightly-only.  `crates/uffs-polars` enables `polars/nightly` unconditionally to unlock Polars's SIMD-accelerated compute kernels, which transitively requires nightly Rust (issue #267 captures the full audit + drop rationale).

The single source of truth for the required toolchain is **`rust-toolchain.toml`** at the workspace root, which pins a specific known-good nightly channel (currently `nightly-2026-05-16`).  Every dev build and every CI job uses this channel.  See that file's header comment for the bump-cadence history, the per-bump rollback rationale, and the upstream-regression tracking that keeps the pin where it is.

Practical implications for contributors:

- **Don't run `cargo +stable …` against the workspace.**  The polars-bound graph will not compile on any stable toolchain; the failure mode is `error[E0554]` inside `foldhash`.
- **Don't add `rust-version = …` to any new manifest.**  The workspace-level claim was dropped in the change that closed #267; per-crate manifests do not carry `rust-version.workspace = true` either.  The `uffs-manifest-audit` tool no longer enforces invariant 3.4 (`rust-version` consistency) — adding back the field will pass the audit silently but will be reverted on review.
- **Bumping the nightly pin** is handled by `just toolchain-sync` (or `just ship --fresh`, which runs `toolchain-sync` as part of the pipeline).  Both update `rust-toolchain.toml` to the latest nightly that compiles the workspace cleanly, log the bump in CHANGELOG, and revert if the new channel regresses any gate.
- **Future MSRV path.**  If a publishable-leaf crate (`uffs-time`, `uffs-text`, `uffs-broker-protocol`) ever needs MSRV verification independent of the polars-bound graph, set MSRV per-crate via that crate's `[package.rust-version]` field and add a focused `cargo +stable check -p <crate>` CI job — do NOT resurrect a workspace-wide claim.

For cross-compilation from macOS/Linux hosts:

- `just setup-cross` — install cross targets used by the workspace
- `just check-cross` — run the CI-style cross-compilation validation
- See `docs/xwin-msvc-rlib-size-root-cause-and-workarounds.md` for `cargo xwin` / MSVC-specific notes

## Preferred validation workflow

Prefer the smallest command that proves your change:

- `just check` — quick workspace validation (`cargo check`, formatting check, file-size policy)
- `just fmt` — format the workspace
- `just test` — workspace tests via nextest/llvm-cov
- `just test-doc` — documentation tests
- `just lint-prod` — strict production Clippy
- `just lint-tests` — test-target Clippy
- `just build` — workspace build
- `just go` — full fast-fail workflow when you want the whole pipeline

Focused examples from the current workflow canon:

- `cargo nextest run -p uffs-mft -- tree`
- `cargo test -p uffs-core -- path_resolver --nocapture`
- `cargo test -p uffs-mft --lib -- --nocapture`

Most tests run cross-platform. Tests that need live MFT access are typically `#[ignore]` and should only be run on Windows with elevation.

## Four-layer quality gates

UFFS uses a shift-left pipeline: cheap checks fire close to the keystroke, expensive ones move rightward into CI. Each layer is fully opt-in via `just install-hooks` and can be bypassed with `--no-verify` for a single commit or push when you need to.

| Layer | Trigger | Recipe | Budget | What it runs |
|------|--------|--------|--------|-------------|
| **IDE save** | On save | `rust-analyzer` | instant | type-check-on-save, clippy-on-save |
| **pre-commit** | `git commit` | `just lint-fast` | sub-2 s (docs-only) / 15–25 s warm (`*.rs` staged) | `fmt --check`, **`lint-prod`** (ultra-strict: pedantic + nursery + cargo + unwrap_used + missing_docs_in_private_items), **`lint-tests`** (same base + unwrap allowed), **`lint-ci`** (CI-mirror `-D warnings --all-targets`) — all when `*.rs` staged; plus `taplo fmt --check` (if `*.toml` staged), `typos`, `reuse lint`, file-size policy — all in parallel; missing optional tools soft-skip.  Windows xwin lint lives at pre-push, not pre-commit (40–90 s cold cost violates T1 budget). |
| **pre-push** | `git push` | `just lint-pre-push` | 25–60 s warm | Same three ultra-strict clippy passes + **Windows `cargo xwin clippy -- -D warnings`** (`lint-ci-windows`, Phase W5.6) + `fmt --check` + `rustdoc -D warnings` + `cargo deny check` + `nextest run --no-run` (test-binary link check) + file-size policy + `typos` + `reuse lint` — all in parallel.  Full parity with `just ship` Phase 1 lint surface plus cross-platform Windows clippy coverage; only the full test runtime (`nextest run`) is deferred to CI. |
| **PR CI** | on PR to `main` | `.github/workflows/pr-fast.yml` | minutes | PR-blocking matrix (classify → file-size, fmt, sanity, clippy, docs, test-build, tests, security, **windows-lint**, required).  The `classify` job short-circuits docs-only / dep-only / infra-only PRs so heavy jobs only run when code actually changed.  Linux jobs run on `ubuntu-22.04`; **`windows-lint`** runs `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` natively on `windows-latest` (Phase W5.5) so both `#[cfg(windows)]` compile errors and lint regressions surface at PR time.  Tier 2 weekly workflow (`.github/workflows/tier-2.yml`) runs coverage + udeps + miri out of the critical path. |
| **Release** | manual today; automated after release-automation R4 | `just ship` today; release-plz release PR after R4 | minutes | today: version bump + `release/vX.Y.Z` PR + signed commit + auto-tag + binary build.  **Target state** (see [`docs/architecture/release-automation-plan.md`](docs/architecture/release-automation-plan.md)): release-plz opens `chore(release): prepare vX.Y.Z` PR automatically from conventional commits on `main`; merging that PR creates the tag; `release.yml` builds binaries as today. |

The ultra-strict flag stack — `common_flags` / `prod_flags` / `test_flags` — is defined in `@/Users/rnio/Private/Github/UltraFastFileSearch/just/shared.just:21-26` and pulled in identically by the local hooks and by `just ship` Phase 1, so **the rules a commit is checked against locally are the exact rules CI enforces**.

### Cross-platform coverage

As of Phase W5 of [`docs/architecture/windows-clippy-and-linux-cross-plan.md`](docs/architecture/windows-clippy-and-linux-cross-plan.md), `pr-fast.yml`'s `windows-lint` job runs strict `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` natively on `windows-latest` so both compile errors and lint regressions on `#[cfg(windows)]` paths surface at PR time.  Pre-push runs the cross-compiled equivalent (`just lint-ci-windows`, ~6 s warm) as an advisory local mirror; CI on `windows-latest` is authoritative.  Breakdown:

- **Windows** — `cargo xwin clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features --no-deps -- -D warnings` via `cargo-xwin` (provisions the MSVC SDK under `~/Library/Caches/xwin/`).  Runs in **~6 s warm** once the SDK is cached.  Wired into pre-push (advisory) and `pr-fast.yml::windows-lint` (authoritative native).
- **Linux** — covered by CI's native `clippy` job on `ubuntu-22.04`.  Two local options for ad-hoc sweeps: **`just lint-ci-linux-zig`** (native macOS → Linux via `cargo-zigbuild`; ~50 s cold / sub-second warm; needs `zig 0.14.1` + `cargo-zigbuild` from `just install-dev-tools`) or **`just lint-ci-linux`** (Docker; mirrors CI's `rust:latest` image exactly; minutes-scale).  Neither runs at pre-push by default.  The zig version is pinned to **0.14.1** — Homebrew's `zig` formula tracks the latest release (currently 0.16.x) which has incompat issues with `psm` and `blake3` x86_64 hand-written SIMD assembly, so `install-dev-tools` downloads the tarball from `ziglang.org` instead.
- **macOS / native host** — covered by the three native clippy passes (`lint-ci` / `lint-prod` / `lint-tests`) at both pre-commit and pre-push.

For a full sweep across all three targets, run `just check-all-targets` (native + xwin + zigbuild-or-Docker Linux).  The recipe prefers zigbuild when `zig` is on `PATH`, falls back to Docker, and soft-skips when neither is available.

### First-time setup

```bash
just install-hooks         # sets core.hooksPath → scripts/hooks/
just install-dev-tools     # installs typos-cli + taplo-cli + cargo-xwin + x86_64-pc-windows-msvc target;
                           # on macOS hosts also installs zig 0.14.1 (from ziglang.org — NOT brew) +
                           # cargo-zigbuild + x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu target;
                           # prints pipx hint for `reuse`
```

Re-run `just install-hooks` after any rebase that touches `scripts/hooks/` — it's idempotent.  The first time `cargo xwin clippy` runs it will download the MSVC SDK into `~/Library/Caches/xwin/` (~1–2 GB); subsequent runs reuse the cache.  `zig` lands in `~/.local/zig/0.14.1/` with a symlink in `~/.cargo/bin/zig` so it shadows any `brew install zig` you may have done previously.

### Running gates manually

```bash
just lint-fast             # the pre-commit bundle on demand
just lint-pre-push         # the pre-push bundle on demand
just lint-ci               # the single clippy gate that CI runs (`--all-targets --all-features --no-deps`)
just lint-ci-linux         # same clippy gate under a Linux x86_64 Docker image (authoritative cross-target)
just lint-ci-linux-zig     # same clippy gate via cargo-zigbuild (native macOS → Linux; no Docker; faster)
just check-windows         # cargo xwin check against x86_64-pc-windows-msvc (compile-only fast check)
just lint-ci-windows       # cargo xwin clippy -- -D warnings (matches `pr-fast.yml::windows-lint`)
just check-all-targets     # full sweep: native + Windows (xwin) + Linux (zigbuild or Docker)
just phase1-test           # the full `just ship` Phase-1 validation (pre-ship rehearsal)
```

### Bypass escape hatches

```bash
git commit --no-verify     # skip pre-commit
git push   --no-verify     # skip pre-push
```

Use them for work-in-progress commits on a feature branch. CI will still enforce the same gates on the PR.

### Keeping hook output fast

The hooks are tuned for an sccache-warm workspace. If you notice cold-cache slowness, verify:

- `cargo install sccache` is installed and `.cargo/config.toml` has `rustc-wrapper = "sccache"` (default).
- `sccache --show-stats` shows a healthy cache-hit rate after a few rebuilds.
- The shared `target/` directory is not being wiped by unrelated tools.

See `@scripts/hooks/_lint_fast.sh` and `@scripts/hooks/_lint_pre_push.sh` for the shared parallel runners both the hooks and the `just` recipes call into — edit there when adjusting the gate set, not in the hooks themselves.

## Target-dir hygiene

`just test` runs `cargo llvm-cov nextest` which writes source-instrumented artifacts into `$CARGO_TARGET_DIR/llvm-cov-target/` — a tree that is entirely separate from regular `cargo build`'s `target/debug/` and `target/release/`, and which can grow to **100 GB+** over a long session of coverage runs (each profile bump recompiles everything; every `.profraw` from a failed / killed run stays cached).  On a near-full disk (Dropbox sync volume, small SSD, external drive) this is the top cause of two otherwise-mysterious test failures:

- `handler::paths_blob_tests::try_pack_paths_blob_offloads_large_blob_to_shmem`
- `handler::csv_blob_tests::try_pack_csv_blob_offloads_large_blob_to_shmem`

Both pin the daemon's **shmem-offload** transport for large search blobs.  When the underlying `write_paths_blob` hits `ENOSPC` / `ERROR_DISK_FULL` during shmem file creation the daemon correctly degrades to inline JSON (see `@/Users/rnio/Private/Github/UltraFastFileSearch/crates/uffs-daemon/src/handler_blob.rs:149-159`), which is exactly what the test asserts against — so the test panics with "*must be offloaded to SearchPayload::ShmemBlob; got InlineBlob(...)*".  This is working as designed: silently skipping under disk pressure would hide a real `write_paths_blob` regression on a healthy host.

Run this on the host that surfaced the failure:

```bash
just clean-cov
```

The recipe (`@/Users/rnio/Private/Github/UltraFastFileSearch/just/cache.just`) prunes:

- `$CARGO_TARGET_DIR/llvm-cov-target/` — the instrumented build tree
- `$CARGO_TARGET_DIR/llvm-cov/` — the HTML coverage report directory
- `$CARGO_TARGET_DIR/**/*.profraw` — leftover instrumentation output from killed / crashed runs
- `$LOCALAPPDATA\uffs\shmem\` (Windows) / `$XDG_DATA_HOME/uffs/shmem/` (Linux) / `~/Library/Application Support/uffs/shmem/` (macOS) — orphan shmem files from aborted daemon sessions

Leaves regular `cargo build` artifacts, the sccache wrapper cache, and the Cargo registry alone, so a subsequent `cargo build` stays incremental.  Empirically frees 5–30 GB on an active dev box and up to 100+ GB after a week of heavy coverage work.

If `just clean-cov` finishes and `just test` still fails with the same shmem-offload assertion, the issue is in `write_paths_blob` itself (a real regression) — check the daemon's stderr for a `tracing::warn!` line beginning `paths_blob shmem write failed; falling back to inline JSON` and open an issue with that error message.

## Commit message conventions

UFFS is migrating to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to drive automated versioning and changelog generation via `release-plz` + `git-cliff`.  For a one-page **"what to do this week"** cheatsheet (PR conventions, what's automatic, FAQs), see [`docs/architecture/release-automation-current-flow.md`](docs/architecture/release-automation-current-flow.md).  The full multi-phase migration plan lives in [`docs/architecture/release-automation-plan.md`](docs/architecture/release-automation-plan.md).

**What matters for you today**:

- The **PR title** (which becomes the squash-merge commit subject) should follow conventional commits.  Intermediate commits on a feature branch don't need to — only what lands on `main`.
- During the **advisory phase** (release-automation Phase R1a, ongoing), non-conforming titles trigger a bot comment but do **not** block merge.  Treat the comment as a nudge, not a gate.
- During the **mandatory phase** (release-automation Phase R1b, scheduled after ≥1 month of advisory observation), non-conforming titles will hard-fail the required PR Fast CI check.

**Recognized types and their release impact**:

| Type | Meaning | Triggers release? | Version bump |
|---|---|---|---|
| `feat:` | User-visible new feature | Yes | Minor (0.X.0) |
| `fix:` | User-visible bug fix | Yes | Patch (0.0.X) |
| `perf:` | Performance improvement | Yes | Patch |
| `feat!:` / `fix!:` | Breaking change (note the `!`) | Yes | Major (X.0.0, or minor pre-1.0) |
| `refactor:` | Code restructure, no behavior change | No | — |
| `docs:` | Documentation only | No | — |
| `test:` | Test additions / changes | No | — |
| `chore:` | Tooling, config, catch-all | No | — |
| `ci:` | CI / workflow change | No | — |
| `build:` | Build system / dependency change | No | — |
| `style:` | Formatting, whitespace | No | — |
| `revert:` | Reverts a previous commit | Inherits reverted type | Inherits |

**Examples**:

- `feat(mft): add zstd-compressed MFT archive support` — minor bump, appears under "Features" in changelog
- `fix(security): correct FNV-1a pipe hash for empty inputs` — patch bump, appears under "Bug Fixes"
- `feat(cli)!: rename --query to --filter; drop deprecated --q shorthand` — major/minor bump (depending on current v0.x vs v1.x), appears under "BREAKING CHANGES"
- `chore: bump dependabot grouping window to weekly` — no release
- `docs(architecture): clarify pipeline stage naming` — no release

**Security commits** use the conventional encoding rather than a top-level `security:` type:

- `fix(security): patch FNV-1a pipe hash for empty inputs` — patch bump, appears under **### Security** in the changelog (the `security` *scope* triggers the dedicated section via `cliff.toml`'s `^fix\(security\)` parser).
- `chore(security): refresh cargo-vet imports` — no bump, also routes to **### Security**.

Top-level `security:` is **not** an allowed type — the local `commit-msg` hook (`scripts/ci/check_commit_subjects.sh`) and the commitlint workflow both reject it, and `release-plz`'s `release_commits` filter no longer includes it as of 2026-05-08.  Historical merges that used `security:` (PRs #31, #33, #34, all pre-hook-installation) remain in the changelog and are documented in `release-automation-baseline.md` §4.

**Scopes** (optional, in parentheses after type): prefer the crate name or a short area tag.  Examples: `mft`, `cli`, `core`, `security`, `polars`, `ci`, `build`, `architecture`.  Omit the scope if the change is workspace-wide.

**If in doubt**, use `chore:` — it never triggers a release.  If a PR genuinely has both a fix and a feature, split it into two PRs.

## Architecture guardrails

- Do not depend on `polars` directly; use `uffs-polars`.
- Preserve the crate layering: `uffs-polars` ← `uffs-mft` ← `uffs-core` ← `uffs-cli`.
- Prefer fixture-, golden-, or saved-MFT/index-based tests for portable validation.
- Update docs when contributor-facing workflow or user-visible behavior changes.
- **New Windows-gated code must pass `just lint-ci-windows` before PR.**  Strict clippy on `#[cfg(windows)]` paths is advisory during the Phase W2–W5 backlog cleanup (see `docs/architecture/windows-clippy-and-linux-cross-plan.md`) and becomes a hard gate at PR CI after W5.  New lints introduced into the backlog trigger an immediate reviewer ask.

## Panic policy

UFFS enforces a strict no-panic posture in production code via three workspace Clippy lints at `deny` level: `unwrap_used`, `expect_used`, and `panic`.  Test code is exempt (see `clippy.toml` `allow-*-in-tests = true`).

The one-line rule: **library code never panics on user input or environment failure; binaries may panic during bootstrap; every other `panic!` / `unwrap()` / `expect()` in production code is a bug.**

Every surviving prod `unwrap` / `expect` / `panic!` fits exactly one of five categories (A–E), each requiring a specific annotation shape:

- **A** — Invariant violation IS a bug (upstream check guarantees the condition): keep as `expect("invariant: <specific condition>")` plus `#[expect(clippy::expect_used, reason = "<invariant + why upstream check guarantees it>")]`.
- **B** — Caller error / validation failure: convert to typed error variant; propagate via `?`.
- **C** — Environmental (IO, mutex poison, syscall): propagate via `?` after `map_err` to a typed error, preserving the source via `#[from]` or `#[source]`.
- **D** — Bootstrap (one-time process startup, crash-correct): keep as `expect("BOOT INVARIANT: <condition>")` with `#[expect(...)]`.
- **E** — Programmer bug at use site: keep as `panic!` with documented invariant in the enclosing function's `# Panics` doc section.

Full taxonomy, anti-patterns, per-crate posture, and the per-site annotation contract live in [`docs/architecture/code-quality/panic_policy.md`](docs/architecture/code-quality/panic_policy.md).  Library crates do not return `anyhow::Error` from public APIs and do not return `Result<_, String>` (banned workspace-wide after Phase 5d); use a typed `thiserror::Error` enum with `#[non_exhaustive]` instead.

## Allocation policy

UFFS enforces a strict clone-and-allocation discipline in production code via five workspace Clippy lints at `deny` level: `redundant_clone`, `clone_on_ref_ptr`, `cloned_instead_of_copied`, `inefficient_to_string`, and `unnecessary_to_owned`.  Test code is exempt.

The one-line rule: **hot paths (per-record / per-row / per-query) never allocate defensively; cold paths (error context, log lines, one-time setup) may allocate freely; every `.clone()` / `format!()` / `to_owned()` in production code must fit one of the five blessed categories (α / β / γ / δ / ε), and δ is a bug.**

Every surviving prod `.clone()` / `format!()` / `to_owned()` fits exactly one of five categories, each requiring a specific annotation shape:

- **α — Arc clone** (`Arc::clone(&x)` form): self-evident; no comment required.  `clone_on_ref_ptr = "deny"` enforces the explicit form.
- **β — Ownership fence** (caller has `&T`, API needs `T`): 1–3 line `//` comment explaining why the alternative (`&T`, in-place mutation) doesn't work.
- **γ — Error / log context** (allocation inside an error variant or `tracing!` event): brief reason; the *category* is self-evident from the context.
- **δ — Hot-path anti-pattern** (clone of `String` / `Vec<T>` inside a per-record loop that could be eliminated): **FIX, do not suppress.**  Refactor the call site with a comment documenting the new (correct) borrow invariant.
- **ε — Test helper** (`#[cfg(test)]`-only allocation): out of scope; test code is exempt.

Full taxonomy, the per-site annotation contract, the workspace inventory script (`scripts/dev/clone_alloc_audit.sh`), and the per-phase decisions log live in [`docs/architecture/code-quality/allocation_policy.md`](docs/architecture/code-quality/allocation_policy.md).

## Trait, generic, and dispatch policy

UFFS enforces a strict trait / generic / dispatch discipline in production code via five workspace Clippy lints: `type_complexity`, `too_many_arguments`, `trait_duplication_in_bounds`, `wrong_self_convention` (all `deny`), and `multiple_bound_locations` (`warn`).  Test code is exempt.

The one-line rule: **a trait must satisfy at least one of [J1] multiple impls / [J2] test substitution / [J3] stable extension / [J4] high-level decoupling — otherwise it's decoration.  Generics stay local.  `dyn` for plugin boundaries; static for closed sets.**

Trait justification four-criterion taxonomy:

- **[J1]** Multiple meaningful implementations (≥ 2 prod impls on `main`).
- **[J2]** Test-substitution boundary (prod impl + ≥ 1 test fake).
- **[J3]** Stable extension surface (rustdoc documents external impls).
- **[J4]** High-level / infrastructure decoupling.

A trait satisfying **none** of J1–J4 → demote to a concrete type and replace usages.

Generic-function categories (G1-LOCAL / G2-USEFUL / G3-SPREAD / G4-CASCADING / G5-CLOSURE), dispatch matrix (D1-PLUGIN / D2-HETERO / D3-NOOP / D4-VTBL-COST), seal-vs-open decision tree, the per-trait registry, the workspace inventory script (`scripts/dev/trait_generic_audit.sh`), and the per-phase decisions log live in [`docs/architecture/code-quality/trait_policy.md`](docs/architecture/code-quality/trait_policy.md).

## Feature flag and dependency policy

UFFS keeps feature behavior additive and dependency duplication audited.  No new clippy lints; the contract is enforced by `cargo deny check`, `cargo machete`, `cargo vet`, and `cargo tree --workspace -d`, all wired into pre-push and `pr-fast.yml::security`.

The one-line rule: **every feature is additive (enabling never removes a `pub` item); every default has a written justification; every optional dep is reachable via `dep:<name>` and at least one `#[cfg(feature = "…")]` use-site; every cross-version duplicate is either in `deny.toml [bans].skip-tree` with a one-line reason or accepted by the workspace's `multiple-versions = "warn"` posture and inventoried in `dependency_policy.md` §5.1.**

Every feature added to the workspace must document the four-line playbook §988 contract in **both** the crate's root rustdoc (`# Features` section) and as a block comment above the `[features]` block in `Cargo.toml`:

- **What it enables** — which module / item / subcommand / binary.
- **What deps it adds** — `dep:<name>` gating + transitive feature pulls.
- **API shape impact** — additive (default) | subtractive (forbidden).
- **Semver claim** — adding items behind it is non-breaking; removing items behind it is breaking.

The feature taxonomy (F1-additive-default-on / F2-additive-default-off / F3-orthogonal / F4-subtractive-FORBIDDEN / F5-feature-on-feature), the cross-version duplicate acceptance inventory, the per-crate feature registry, the workspace inventory script (`scripts/dev/feature_dep_audit.sh`), and the per-phase decisions log live in [`docs/architecture/code-quality/dependency_policy.md`](docs/architecture/code-quality/dependency_policy.md).

## Build, codegen, and env-var policy

UFFS keeps compile-time magic justified and traceable.  No new clippy lints; the contract is enforced by `scripts/dev/build_codegen_audit.sh` plus the existing `manifest-drift` / `hooks-drift` / `fast-drift` / `workflow-drift` gates wired into pre-push and `pr-fast.yml`.

The one-line rule: **every `build.rs` falls into one of the three playbook §1041-1046 justification classes; every `macro_rules!` falls into one of the three playbook §1064 justification classes (control-flow hiding is forbidden); every codegen binary has a drift detector or a documented "no idempotency contract" rationale; every environment variable the workspace reads is in `build_codegen_policy.md` §5 with name, scope, type, default, where read, and semver class.**

Current posture (as of Phase 9 entry, SHA `0433065c7`):

- **1 `build.rs`** (`uffs-cli`) — MSVC-gated PE resource embedding + `/DELAYLOAD` linker args.
- **0 proc-macro crates** — deliberate workspace posture; introducing one requires unanimous review.
- **6 `macro_rules!` declarations** — all in `uffs-mft`, all `pub(crate)`-scoped or function-local.
- **4 codegen binaries** — 3 emitter/validators (drift-detected) + 1 release orchestrator.
- **36 distinct env-var names** across 7 scope categories (build-time, standard runtime, logging, UFFS runtime knobs, client knobs, build/release knobs, test-only).

The `build.rs` / proc-macro / `macro_rules!` / codegen / env-var per-class contracts, the per-crate registry, the env-var registry, the workspace inventory script (`scripts/dev/build_codegen_audit.sh`), and the per-phase decisions log live in [`docs/architecture/code-quality/build_codegen_policy.md`](docs/architecture/code-quality/build_codegen_policy.md).

## Concurrency policy

UFFS enforces a strict task-ownership, lock-discipline, channel-backpressure, timeout-coverage, and blocking-IO posture in production async code.  Three workspace Clippy lints at `deny` cover the std-side lock-across-await family (`await_holding_lock`, `await_holding_refcell_ref`, `await_holding_invalid_type`); the rest is enforced by `scripts/dev/concurrency_audit.sh` + a per-site annotation contract.

The one-line rule: **every `tokio::spawn` declares its owner / shutdown / errors / cancellation; every async lock guard is dropped before the next `.await`; every channel is bounded with documented capacity OR unbounded with a documented producer-rate ceiling; every cross-process / cross-thread / cross-network await has a timeout OR is justified as a cooperatively-cancelled forever-loop; every `std::fs::*` / `std::thread::sleep` inside an `async fn` is wrapped in `spawn_blocking` / `block_in_place` OR is a sync helper called only from sync contexts.**

Five dimensions, each with a taxonomy contributors quote inline:

- **Task ownership** (`T1` named-constructor / `T2` inline-spawn / `T3` fire-and-forget / `T4` test-only) — every prod spawn site documents the four facets above.
- **Lock discipline** (`L1`-`L5` patterns; `L6` lock-across-await is forbidden) — three Clippy `await_holding_*` lints at `deny`.
- **Channel discipline** (`C1` bounded / `C2` broadcast / `C3` oneshot / `C4` watch / `C5` unbounded-with-ceiling; `C6` undocumented unbounded is forbidden).
- **Timeout policy** (`W1` named const / `W2` env-overridable / `W3` cooperatively-cancelled forever-loop / `W4` inline literal; `W5` unbounded cross-process await is forbidden).
- **Blocking-IO rule** (`B1` `spawn_blocking` / `B2` `block_in_place` / `B3` sync helper / `B4` startup/Drop/CLI one-shot; `B5` unbounded sync I/O on runtime worker is forbidden).

Full taxonomy, per-site annotation templates, the workspace inventory script (`scripts/dev/concurrency_audit.sh`), per-crate posture matrix, and the per-phase audit trail live in [`docs/architecture/code-quality/concurrency_policy.md`](docs/architecture/code-quality/concurrency_policy.md).

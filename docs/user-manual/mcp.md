# MCP Server

> Give every AI agent instant access to your filesystem.

The UFFS MCP server bridges AI agents to the UFFS daemon using the
[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).  Any MCP-compatible
host — Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, Augment, Codeium, or your own
tooling — can search, aggregate, and inspect files through UFFS with zero
setup beyond a single config line.

## How It Works

```
┌──────────────┐                    ┌──────────────┐              ┌─────────────┐
│ AI Agent     │   MCP (stdio or    │ UFFS MCP     │  IPC socket  │ uffs-daemon  │
│ (Claude,     ├───HTTP)───────────▶│ Server       ├─────────────▶│ (in-memory   │
│  Cursor, …)  │   JSON-RPC 2.0    │ (bridge)     │              │  MFT index)  │
└──────────────┘                    └──────────────┘              └─────────────┘
```

The MCP server is a **thin bridge** — it translates MCP tool calls into
daemon queries and returns results.  It does not hold index data itself.
The daemon must be running (it auto-starts when needed).

## 1  Two transports

| | HTTP (recommended) | stdio |
|---|---|---|
| **Sessions** | Multi-session — many agents share one server | Single-session per AI host |
| **Lifecycle** | You manage: `uffs --mcp start` / `stop` | AI host manages: spawns and kills |
| **Persistence** | Stays running between agent restarts | Dies when agent disconnects |
| **Setup** | One `start`, then point hosts at URL | Config per host with `command` + `args` |
| **Auth** | Optional bearer token | No auth (pipe is private) |
| **Best for** | Production, shared environments, many hosts | Quick setup, single-agent use |

---

## 2  Quick start

### HTTP mode

```bash
# Start the MCP HTTP server (auto-starts daemon too)
# Windows — auto-discovers NTFS drives:
uffs --mcp start

# macOS / Linux — provide MFT data:
uffs --mcp start --data-dir ~/uffs_data

# Custom port:
uffs --mcp start --port 9090

# With authentication:
uffs --mcp start --auth-token MY_SECRET_TOKEN

# Check status:
uffs --mcp status

# Performance stats:
uffs --mcp stats

# Stop:
uffs --mcp stop
```

### stdio mode

```bash
# Typically not run manually — configured in the AI host's MCP settings.
# The host spawns this process and communicates via stdin/stdout.
uffs --mcp run --data-dir ~/uffs_data
```

### Zero-downtime upgrades (stdio supervisor)

Every stdio session is fronted by a tiny **self-upgrading supervisor**:
the process the AI host spawns owns the stdio pipes for the whole
session and serves through a hidden worker child it can replace.  When
the `uffsmcp` binary on disk is replaced (an installer or `just
use-local` rename-swap), the supervisor notices, waits for a quiet
moment (no request in flight), spawns a fresh worker from the new
binary, replays the MCP handshake into it, and reroutes traffic — then
notifies the client with `notifications/tools/list_changed` so a
changed toolset is re-listed.  The host's MCP connection never drops:
**a new binary is picked up without restarting any AI-host session**.
The same path transparently restarts a crashed worker (rate-limited).

No configuration is needed.  Tuning knobs (rarely needed):

| Variable | Effect | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `UFFS_MCP_WORKER_EXE` | Program spawned as the worker | the supervisor's own executable |
| `UFFS_MCP_WATCH_PATH` | File whose identity change triggers a swap | the worker executable |
| `UFFS_MCP_POLL_MS` | How often the binary is checked (ms) | `5000` |

---

## 3  Host configuration

### Claude Desktop / Claude Code

Add to `settings.json` or `claude_desktop_config.json`:

**HTTP mode:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "uffs": {
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8080/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

**stdio mode:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "uffs": {
      "command": "uffs",
      "args": ["mcp", "run", "--data-dir", "/path/to/uffs_data"]
    }
  }
}
```

Windows (no `--data-dir` needed):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "uffs": {
      "command": "uffs",
      "args": ["mcp", "run"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor

Add to `.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "uffs": {
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8080/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### Windsurf

Add to `mcp_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "uffs": {
      "serverUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:8080/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### Augment Code

HTTP mode is auto-detected when the server is running.  Stdio mode:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "uffs": {
      "command": "uffs",
      "args": ["mcp", "run", "--data-dir", "/path/to/uffs_data"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Standalone binary (alternative)

The `uffs-mcp` binary can be used instead of `uffs --mcp run`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "uffs": {
      "command": "uffs-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## 4  Tools

The MCP server exposes six read-only tools.  All are annotated as
`readOnlyHint: true` — they never modify the filesystem.

| Tool | Required params | Description |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| `uffs_search` | `pattern` | Search files and directories with 40+ filter parameters |
| `uffs_aggregate` | — | Server-side analytics with 12 built-in presets |
| `uffs_facet_values` | `field` | Discover distinct values (extension, type, drive) with counts |
| `uffs_info` | `path` | Full metadata for a single file or directory |
| `uffs_drives` | — | List all indexed drives with record counts |
| `uffs_status` | — | Daemon health, uptime, memory, loading progress |

### `uffs_search`

The primary query tool.  Accepts a `pattern` and any combination of filters
(all ANDed).  See [Search Modes](search-modes.md) for pattern syntax and
[Filters](filters.md) for the full parameter list.

Key parameters:

| Parameter | Example | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `pattern` | `"*.pdf"`, `"invoice"`, `">report_[0-9]+"` | Glob, substring, or regex (prefix `>`) |
| `filter` | `"files"`, `"dirs"`, `"all"` | File/directory filter |
| `ext` | `"pdf"`, `"pictures"`, `"archives"` | Extension or collection alias |
| `type_filter` | `"code"`, `"document"`, `"picture"` | Semantic type category |
| `min_size` / `max_size` | `1073741824` | Size in bytes (1 073 741 824 = 1 GB) |
| `newer` / `older` | `"7d"`, `"today"`, `"2026-01-01"` | Modification time filter |
| `path_contains` | `"Users\\rnio"` | Scope to a subtree |
| `drives` | `["C", "D"]` | Scope to specific drives |
| `sort` | `"-size"`, `"modified"`, `"-treesize"` | Sort field (prefix `-` for descending) |
| `limit` | `50` | Max results (default 50, cap 500) |
| `projection` | `["name", "size", "path"]` | Columns to return |
| `whole_word` | `true` | Word-boundary matching |
| `attr` | `"hidden"`, `"compressed"` | NTFS attribute filter |

### `uffs_aggregate`

Server-side analytics.  Use `preset` for one-call answers or `aggregations`
for custom specs.  See [Aggregation](aggregation.md) for full documentation.

```json
{ "preset": "overview" }
{ "preset": "by_type", "drives": ["C"] }
{ "aggregations": ["terms:extension,top=30", "stats:size"] }
```

Available presets: `overview`, `by_type`, `by_extension`, `by_drive`,
`by_size`, `by_age`, `storage`, `activity`, `top_folders`, `duplicates`,
`media`, `cleanup`.

### `uffs_facet_values`

Discover what exists before searching.  Returns top-N values with counts
and byte totals.

```json
{ "field": "extension", "top": 20 }
{ "field": "type", "pattern": "*.log" }
{ "field": "drive" }
```

### `uffs_info`

Full metadata for a single path:

```json
{ "path": "C:\\Windows\\System32\\ntoskrnl.exe" }
```

Returns: size, allocated size, created/modified/accessed timestamps, NTFS
flags, MFT record number, parent directory path.

## 5  Resources

Resources are **read-only data** that agents can access even when tool
invocation is unavailable.  This is critical — some MCP clients expose
`resources/read` but not `tools/call`.

| URI | Content | Agent use |
|-----|---------|-----------|
| `uffs://cookbook` | Curated example queries with ready-to-use arguments | **Start here** — learn query patterns fast |
| `uffs://schema/search` | JSON Schema for `uffs_search` parameters | Validate/construct search calls |
| `uffs://schema/aggregate` | JSON Schema for `uffs_aggregate` parameters | Validate/construct aggregate calls |
| `uffs://schema/fields` | Complete field catalog (types, capabilities) | Discover filterable/sortable fields |
| `uffs://presets/aggregate` | Aggregate preset names with descriptions | Choose the right preset |
| `uffs://drives` | Live drive listing with record counts | Check what's indexed |
| `uffs://status` | Daemon health, loading progress | Check readiness |

### Resource templates

| URI template | Example | Content |
|---|---|---|
| `uffs://info/{path}` | `uffs://info/C%3A%5CWindows` | File/directory metadata |

The `{path}` segment is percent-encoded (`:` → `%3A`, `\` → `%5C`).

---

## 6  Prompts

Prompts are **guided multi-step workflows** that an agent can request
and then execute step-by-step.

| Prompt | Parameters | Workflow |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| `find_large_files` | `limit` (default 50) | Search for largest files |
| `find_by_extension` | `extension`, `limit` | Find all files with a given extension |
| `recent_changes` | `days` (default 1) | Files modified in the last N days |
| `find_duplicates_by_name` | `filename` | Find files with the same name across drives |
| `disk_usage_report` | `drive` (optional) | Multi-step: overview → type → extension → largest files |
| `cleanup_report` | `min_size_mb` (default 100) | Temp files, zero-byte, cleanup preset |
| `duplicate_investigation` | `extension` (optional) | Aggregate duplicates → search candidates |

Agents request a prompt via `prompts/get`, receive structured instructions,
then execute the steps using the tools above.

## 7  Server management

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `uffs --mcp start` | Start the HTTP gateway as a background process |
| `uffs --mcp status` | Show PID, uptime, HTTP health, and load stats |
| `uffs --mcp stats` | Show performance metrics (queries, timing, sessions) |
| `uffs --mcp stop` | Graceful shutdown via HTTP `/shutdown` |
| `uffs --mcp kill` | Hard kill (SIGKILL / taskkill) + PID file cleanup |
| `uffs --mcp restart` | Stop → start with the same configuration |
| `uffs --mcp reload` | SIGHUP all stdio sessions + restart HTTP gateway |

### Status

```
$ uffs --mcp status

## 8  HTTP endpoints

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/mcp` | Bearer (if configured) | MCP Streamable HTTP (JSON-RPC 2.0) |
| `GET` | `/mcp` | Bearer (if configured) | SSE event stream for server notifications |
| `DELETE` | `/mcp` | Bearer (if configured) | Close session |
| `GET` | `/health` | None | Liveness probe — always `200 OK` |
| `GET` | `/status` | None | Server status + uptime JSON |

### Authentication

When started with `--auth-token`, the HTTP gateway requires a bearer token
on all `/mcp` requests:

```bash
uffs --mcp start --auth-token MY_SECRET

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/mcp \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer MY_SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize",...}'
```

The `/health` and `/status` endpoints are always unauthenticated.

### Health check

```bash
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/health
OK

$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/status
{
  "status": "ok",
  "uptime_secs": 3421,
  "sessions_active": 2,
  "tool_calls_total": 847
}
```

## 9  Agent instructions

When an agent connects, the MCP server sends **agent instructions** as part
of the `initialize` response.  These instructions teach the agent:

- All 6 tools with one-line descriptions
- A **query strategy** (aggregate → facet → search) that minimizes round-trips
- Key parameters cheat sheet for `uffs_search`
- Resource listing (including the cookbook)
- Prompt listing

This means an agent can start using UFFS effectively without reading any
external documentation — the instructions are embedded in the protocol.

---

## 10  Cookbook

The `uffs://cookbook` resource is the **single most useful resource** for
agents learning to use UFFS.  It contains ~30 ready-to-use examples
organized into 10 categories:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|---------|
| Quick Find | Glob, substring, whole-word, regex, drive-scoped |
| Size Triage | Top-N largest, >1 GB, large archives |
| Time Filters | Last 7d, >2yr old, created today |
| Type & Extension | Pictures, code, executables |
| Path Scoping | User home dir, project dirs, config files |
| Subtree Analysis | Largest dirs, empty dirs, crowded dirs |
| Cleanup | Temp files, zero-byte, bulkiness, long paths |
| Aggregation | All presets, scoped, custom specs |
| Facets | Extensions, drives, scoped facets |
| Advanced | Hidden files, NTFS compression, multi-step workflows |

Each example includes:
- **tool** — which tool to call
- **arguments** — a complete JSON object, copy-pasteable into `tools/call`
- **explanation** — why each parameter was chosen

Plus 12 power-user tips for combining parameters effectively.

---

## 11  Idle timeout and auto-exit

### stdio mode

The stdio server has an **idle timeout** (default: 2 hours).  If no MCP
messages are received within the window, the server exits cleanly.

```json
{
  "command": "uffs",
  "args": ["mcp", "run", "--idle-timeout", "3600"]
}
```

Set `--idle-timeout 0` to disable.

The timeout uses a **sliding window** — every MCP request resets the
deadline.  A busy agent will never trigger it.

### HTTP mode

The HTTP gateway runs indefinitely.  Use `uffs --mcp stop` to shut it down.

---

## 12  Logging and diagnostics

**stdout is the protocol channel** — all diagnostic output goes to stderr
or a log file.

```bash
# Default: INFO to stderr
uffs --mcp run

# Verbose: auto-creates log file
UFFS_LOG=debug uffs --mcp run

# Explicit log file
UFFS_LOG_FILE=/tmp/mcp.log uffs --mcp run

# Both
UFFS_LOG=trace UFFS_LOG_FILE=/tmp/mcp-diag.log uffs --mcp run
```

Default log file location:
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/uffs/uffs_mcp.log`
- Linux: `~/.local/share/uffs/uffs_mcp.log`
- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\uffs\uffs_mcp.log`

---

## 13  Relationship to the daemon

The MCP server is **not** the daemon.  They are separate processes:

| | Daemon (`uffs-daemon`) | MCP Server (`uffs --mcp`) |
|---|---|---|
| **Role** | Holds MFT index in memory, executes queries | Bridges MCP protocol to daemon |
| **Data** | Yes — full file index | No — stateless bridge |
| **Started by** | Auto-started by first client | `uffs --mcp start` or AI host |
| **Stopped by** | `uffs --daemon stop` or idle timeout | `uffs --mcp stop` or AI host disconnect |
| **Multiple?** | One daemon per machine | Many MCP servers (one per AI host session) |

When the MCP server connects, it auto-starts the daemon if needed.
Stopping the MCP server does **not** stop the daemon — other clients
(CLI, TUI, other MCP sessions) may still be using it.

//! [`crate::snapshot_lease::VssProvider`] implementation backed by
//! `uffs-vss-requestor`: spawns one helper process per snapshot, keeps
//! it alive (assigned to a `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE` Job
//! Object) for the lease's entire lifetime, and drives it over a private
//! JSON-lines control pipe. See
//! `docs/dev/architecture/uffs-vss-rust-cpp-shim-implementation-guide.md`
//! for the full design.
//!
//! The wire shape here (`HelperEvent`/`BrokerCommand`) is a deliberate,
//! documented duplicate of `uffs-vss-requestor::protocol` — that crate
//! is bin-only (no library target) and this protocol is tiny, private,
//! and owned end-to-end by this same Broker↔helper pairing, so a
//! dedicated shared protocol crate (the pattern this workspace otherwise
//! uses for every cross-process wire boundary) would be overhead without
//! benefit here. Keep the two definitions in sync by hand if either side
//! changes.

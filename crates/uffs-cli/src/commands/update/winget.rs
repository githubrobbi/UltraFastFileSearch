//! `WinGet` upgrade orchestration for `uffs --update` (the "update flow,
//! winget-delegating").
//!
//! `winget upgrade` on a portable/zip package is an uninstall + reinstall, so
//! it fails with `remove_all: Access is denied` whenever a UFFS process runs
//! FROM the package dir (reproduced live: the daemon and the broker service
//! both ran from the winget root). The user verb stays `uffs --update`; winget
//! hears its own verb internally.
//!
//! Flow (Windows; a no-op elsewhere), quiesce-first so BOTH the hand-rolled
//! `~\bin` update and the winget upgrade run against a stopped install:
//!
//! 1. [`quiesce`] — stop the daemon (shutdown RPC; no privileges) and, when the
//!    broker service runs from the winget package, stop it via ONE elevated
//!    helper held open across the whole update. The helper reports its real
//!    outcome (and the measured stop/start durations) through result files, so
//!    a slow stop is surfaced honestly — never a bogus "UAC declined".
//! 2. The caller runs the hand-rolled update, then [`run_upgrade`] runs `winget
//!    upgrade` (deferred past process exit when the running uffs.exe is itself
//!    part of the package).
//! 3. [`resume`] — release the helper (it restarts the broker) and restart the
//!    daemon.
//!
//! Every wait shows a spinner: on an AV-throttled box service control legit-
//! imately takes a minute-plus (~90s broker start observed), and silent
//! minutes read as a hang.

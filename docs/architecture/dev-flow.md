**Changelog**
- 2026-04-23 — Initial doc after v0.5.71 ship post-mortem.  Surfaced three
  bugs (ship resumable push-skip, `CARGO_INCREMENTAL` vs sccache drift,
  `rust-script` stale cache) and three shift-left gaps
  (`cargo vet`, doc tests, `cargo machete`) exposed by PR #43's
  four-iteration supply-chain failure loop.
- 2026-04-23 — External review pointed out structural gaps: v1 treats
  CI as one long lane, soft-skips gates that should be hard-required,
  and proposes a split-brain cache policy.  Follow-up captured in
  `dev-flow-implementation-plan.md`; §6 of this doc is retained for
  historical context but the plan doc is the authoritative roadmap.
- 2026-04-23 — Plan doc revised to **v3** after a second external
  review round.  Eleven correctness fixes to the v2 plan: `required`
  aggregator now depends on `classify`; compile/test gates use
  `code_changed = rust || dep || infra` (not just `rust`);
  pre-push reads git's stdin protocol; preview workflow gates on
  `PR Fast CI / required` being green for the same SHA; new §2.8
  Actions hardening policy.  See `dev-flow-implementation-plan.md`
  §10 for the full diff.

## 1. Purpose

This document is the **single source of truth for where each quality gate
lives and why**.  It exists because today (2026-04-22 → 23) a straightforward
patch release loop (v0.5.71) needed four ship attempts to land on origin,
and three of those four failures were preventable by moving one CI-only
gate earlier in the flow.

Who this is for:

- Any contributor modifying `.github/workflows/*.yml`,
  `scripts/hooks/*.sh`, `scripts/ci/ci-pipeline.rs`, or `just/*.just`.
- Future-me reading the reflog wondering "why did we move `cargo vet`
  from CI to pre-push".
- New contributors trying to understand why `git commit` is fast but
  `git push` takes 30 seconds.

---

## 2. Principles

### 2.1 Shift-left — but only when the cost curve crosses

A gate's ideal tier is **the earliest tier where its runtime cost is still
acceptable for the frequency of that tier**.  Run too early and every
commit/push is a slog.  Run too late and broken code escapes to CI, where
the feedback loop is ~10× slower (fetch runner → clone → install nightly →
warm caches → run gate → report).

The decision rule:

```
if gate_runtime < tier_budget AND gate_needs_no_remote_infra:
    shift it one tier earlier
```

### 2.2 Four tiers, four budgets

| Tier | Trigger | Budget | Philosophy |
|------|---------|--------|------------|
| **T0 — editor-time** | on save / on keystroke | &lt; 100 ms | rust-analyzer, clippy-on-save.  Must not block typing. |
| **T1 — pre-commit** | `git commit` | &lt; 25 s warm | Cheap, staged-file scoped.  Soft-skip optional tools. |
| **T2 — pre-push** | `git push` | &lt; 60 s warm | Workspace-wide.  Catch everything locally reproducible. |
| **T3 — CI on PR** | push to PR branch | 8–15 min | Full matrix + things that need remote infra (coverage upload, SBOM, SLSA, CodeQL). |
| **T4 — CI nightly** | `schedule:` cron | 60–90 min | Slow, probabilistic (miri, mutation testing, fuzz). |

### 2.3 Defense-in-depth, not duplicated work

Running clippy at both pre-commit AND pre-push is **intentional**:
pre-commit is the fast daily-driver path; pre-push is the backstop when a
contributor uses `git commit --no-verify`.  The file-locking behavior of
cargo's target-dir means consecutive clippy invocations reuse artifacts —
the second one costs ~1–3 s.  That's correct engineering.

### 2.4 Tooling must be soft-skippable

A first-time contributor should be able to clone, `just install-hooks`, and
work immediately without `typos`, `taplo`, `reuse`, or `cargo-vet`
installed.  Every optional gate in `_lint_fast.sh` and `_lint_pre_push.sh`
must `command -v` check and print a one-line install hint on miss.

CI catches something local never runs.

### 3.3 Measured budgets (current)

- **Pre-commit** — 2 s docs-only, 15–25 s with Rust changes warm sccache.
  Stays under the "must not block flow" threshold.  (Phase 2 removed xwin
  from this tier — its 40–90 s cold cost violated the T1 budget.)
- **Pre-push** — 23–45 s warm, 60–90 s cold.  Heaviest jobs: rustdoc and
  nextest `--no-run` share the same target-dir.  File-locking serializes
  them; the non-cargo jobs (deny, typos, reuse, file-size) genuinely run
  in parallel.
- **Tier 1 CI** — 8–12 min all jobs parallel.  Heaviest: `tests` (depends
  on `test-build` artifact cache).
- **Tier 2 CI** — 60–90 min.  Heaviest: `miri` (90 min timeout) and
  `coverage` (polars compile under `llvm-cov` instrumentation).

## 4. Gap Analysis — What CI Catches That Local Doesn't

### 4.1 GAP 1 — `cargo vet check --locked` is CI-only (✅ CLOSED 2026-04-23)

**Original evidence**: PR #43 (v0.5.71) failed CI's `Tier 1 / Security`
job three times with `pastey:0.2.2 missing ["safe-to-deploy"]` and
`rustls:0.23.39 missing ["safe-to-deploy"]`.  Local pre-push never
flagged either — `cargo vet` was only invoked in
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

**Original shift-left rationale**:

- Cost to run locally: **1–2 s** (no compile; walks the dep graph
  against `supply-chain/audits.toml` + `imports.lock`).
- Inputs are 100% local: `Cargo.lock`, `supply-chain/*.toml`.  No
  network, no compile, no cache.
- The tool was already in `just/dev.just`'s `update-tools` list — any
  maintainer running `just update-tools` had it.

**Resolution**: Closed 2026-04-23 via PR #45 ("feat: shift-left dev-flow
rollout (phases 1-7)") — Phase 1 of §6 below.  `scripts/hooks/_lint_pre_push.sh:224`
now runs `cargo vet check --locked` at pre-push, dep-gated on
`Cargo.{toml,lock}` or `supply-chain/` changes so the cost is paid only
on PRs that could possibly fail it.  Formalised on 2026-05-06 via PR
#140 / PR #141 (gates manifest Phases 1–2): the gate now appears as
`[[gate]] id = "vet"` in `scripts/ci/gates.toml` and is regenerated
into the pre-push hook by `just uffs-gen-hooks`.  An adjacent
`vet-audit-discipline` gate (PR #172, 2026-05-12) enforces that every
`[[exemptions.<crate>]]` version-bump carries a matching
`[[audits.<crate>]]` delta + `Vet-Reviewed-Diff:` commit trailer.

### 4.2 GAP 2 — pre-push compiles tests but never runs them (✅ CLOSED 2026-04-23)

**Original evidence**: `scripts/hooks/_lint_pre_push.sh` ran
`cargo nextest run --workspace --all-targets --all-features --no-run`.
The `--no-run` means "link all test binaries, then exit".  CI's
`Tier 1 / Tests` job ran `cargo nextest run ... --profile ci` (without
`--no-run`), which actually executed them.

**Class of bugs this missed locally**:

- Flaky tests with a timing dependency.
- Tests that depend on environment (tmpdir perms, `/tmp` being
  writable, localhost DNS).
- Assertions that are correct at compile time but wrong at runtime
  (e.g. `assert_eq!(computed, constant)` where `constant` went stale).

**Why `--no-run` was originally correct**: Running the full suite warm
is ~2–3 min on this workspace.  That blows the 60 s pre-push budget
and destroys developer flow.

**Resolution**: Closed 2026-04-23 via PR #45 — Phase 2 of §6 below.
Added a `pre-push-smoke` nextest profile in `.config/nextest.toml`
(test-threads = -2, retries = 0, fail-fast = true, 30 s slow-timeout)
that denylists the heavy integration suite (`validate_*`) and the
`uffs-client` shmem tests (which serialise globally via
`threads-required = num-cpus`).  Everything else — unit tests across
all remaining crates — *does* run at pre-push.  Wall-time: 10–20 s
warm on a developer laptop.

`scripts/hooks/_lint_pre_push.sh:241–242` now runs **both** the
`--no-run` test-compile *and* the `pre-push-smoke` execution:

```sh
run_seq "tests" cargo nextest run --workspace --all-targets --all-features --no-run --locked --hide-progress-bar
run_seq "smoke" cargo nextest run --workspace --profile pre-push-smoke --locked
```

The full-suite execution stays at PR-time (`pr-fast.yml::tests`) as
the authoritative gate, with the smoke profile as the inner-loop
backstop.  Long-term plan (per the nextest config docstring):
replace the package-level denylist with per-test `slow` attributes
so the filter becomes `not attr(slow)` instead of an opaque list.

### 4.3 GAP 3 — doc tests are pre-push's blind spot (✅ CLOSED 2026-04-23)

**Original evidence**: pre-push ran `cargo doc -Dwarnings` which only
checked that docs *compile*.  The `cargo test --doc` step (which runs
the `/// ```rust` blocks as actual tests) was CI-only.

**Original cost-locally**: 10–30 s warm.  Most workspace crates have
&lt;20 doctests.

**Resolution**: Closed 2026-04-23 via PR #45 — Phase 2 of §6 below.
`scripts/hooks/_lint_pre_push.sh:240` now runs
`RUSTDOCFLAGS=-Dwarnings cargo test --doc --workspace --all-features
--locked` at pre-push.  Codified into the gates manifest on
2026-05-06 via PR #141 as `[[gate]] id = "doc-tests"` in
`scripts/ci/gates.toml`; the gate is regenerated into the hook by
`just uffs-gen-hooks`.

### 4.4 GAP 4 — unused-dependency detection is weekly-only (✅ CLOSED 2026-05-12)

**Original evidence**: `cargo udeps` runs only in `tier-2.yml:166-191`.
A PR that removes the last use of a workspace dep accumulated cruft
until the next Monday's Tier 2 run.

**Resolution**: `cargo machete` (sub-second AST-based unused-dep
detector — static-analysis sibling of `cargo-udeps`, no nightly
required) promoted to a **hard gate at pre-push + pr-fast** via
`scripts/ci/gates.toml [[gate]] id = "machete"` and the
`pr-fast.yml::security` job's step list.  Added to
`just install-dev-tools` so contributors onboard with the binary
required by the gate.  See
[the §12 Decisions Log entry for 2026-05-12 `cargo-machete` in `code-quality/lint-posture.md`](code-quality/lint-posture.md#12--decisions-log)
for the full decision-log record.

`cargo-udeps` stays at Tier 2 weekly as the authoritative
compile-driven check — it catches deps used only behind `#[cfg]`
gates that machete's static grep misses.  The two are complementary,
not redundant: machete is the fast inner-loop check, udeps is the
thorough weekly sweep.

### 4.5 GAP 5 — CodeQL is intentionally CI-only (🟢 LEAVE)

CodeQL SAST is a heavyweight GitHub-hosted tool.  Running locally requires
downloading the CodeQL CLI + the Rust extractor (~400 MB).  Not worth it
— clippy (`--pedantic --nursery --cargo`) plus weekly miri covers ~80% of
what CodeQL would catch for this codebase.  This gate stays where it is.

### 4.6 GAP 6 — Transient infra failures had no recovery path (✅ CLOSED 2026-05-12)

**Original evidence**: GitHub Actions' "Set up job" phase downloads
every `uses: <action>@<sha>` tarball from `codeload.github.com`
before any of our YAML steps run.  When `codeload.github.com` rate-
limits the runner's IP (HTTP 429 / `Too Many Requests`), the runner
exhausts its 3 built-in retries (with 10 s and 12 s exponential
backoff) and then fails the entire job.  No per-step retry action
(`nick-fields/retry@v3` or similar) can help — the failure happens
*before* any step gets a chance to execute.

Observed on PR #175 (zstd retire-vestige) and PR #174 (cargo-machete)
on 2026-05-12: CodeQL's "Set up job" 429'd while downloading the
`github/codeql-action` tarball; the analyse job died.  Same
infrastructure issue could hit pr-fast.yml or tier-2.yml and would
appear as a "real" CI failure, blocking merge until a maintainer
manually clicked "Re-run failed jobs".

**Resolution**: Two-layer hardening landed in this PR:

- **Layer A** — `continue-on-error: true` on `codeql.yml::analyze`.
  Codifies the workflow's own docstring (which already said *"the
  check is NOT wired into branch protection"*) at the workflow-
  engine level.  CodeQL job failures still show as ❌ in the PR's
  check-runs panel, but the workflow conclusion is `success` so
  branch protection / auto-merge are not affected.

- **Layer B** — new `auto-rerun-transient.yml` watcher.  Triggers
  on `workflow_run` completion of the three main workflows
  (`PR Fast CI`, `🔍 CodeQL (Rust SAST)`, `🌙 UFFS Tier 2 Nightly
  CI`).  For each completed run with `run_attempt < 2` (loop
  prevention), it inspects the logs of every failed job; if any
  log matches a transient-infra regex (`429` / `ECONNRESET` /
  `EAI_AGAIN` / `runner has lost contact` / `No space left on
  device` / etc.) it calls `POST /actions/runs/<id>/rerun-failed-
  jobs` to re-execute exactly the failed jobs once.  Persistent
  failures (real compile / test errors) do not match the regex and
  stay red.

**Bounded retry**: `run_attempt < 2` enforces *exactly one*
auto-rerun per run.  If the rerun also fails with a transient
signature, the second attempt (`run_attempt = 2`) is *not*
re-retried — a human investigates.  Worst-case overhead: ~30 s per
transient failure, single-digit per week.

**Policy classification** added by this PR:

| Job kind | Branch protection | Failure visibility | Auto-rerun? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Required (pr-fast.yml `required` aggregator) | blocks merge | red ❌ until fixed | yes if transient |
| Advisory (`continue-on-error: true`) | does not block | red ❌ on job, ✅ workflow | yes if transient |
| Tier 2 weekly | does not block PRs | `ci-failure-tier-2` issue auto-opened | yes if transient |

### 4.7 GAP 7 — MSRV verification (⛔ RECLASSIFIED “·N/A·” 2026-05-18 via issue #267)

**Original framing (2026-05-12)**: The workspace declared
`rust-version = "1.91"` and the `tier-2.yml::msrv` job was added
to verify the claim with `cargo +1.91 check --workspace --locked
--all-features` plus a sibling `--no-default-features` run.

**Why the original framing was wrong (2026-05-18)**: The very
first run of the new job (issue #267, commit `e8b6bdf`) failed
immediately with `error[E0554]` inside `foldhash-0.2.0/src/lib.rs`.
The root cause is structural:

- `crates/uffs-polars/Cargo.toml` enables `polars/nightly`
  unconditionally in the polars dependency declaration to unlock
  Polars's SIMD-accelerated compute kernels.
- `polars/nightly` propagates to `foldhash/nightly` via the polars
  dep graph.
- `foldhash`'s `nightly` feature compiles `#![feature(...)]` —
  invalid on any stable toolchain.
- No cargo invocation (`--all-features`, `--no-default-features`,
  workspace exclusion of `uffs-polars`) can break this chain: every
  consumer crate transitively depends on `uffs-polars`, and the
  `polars/nightly` enablement is at the dep-declaration level (not
  behind a `uffs-polars`-side feature flag).

The `rust-version = "1.91"` claim was therefore unverifiable from
the moment `uffs-polars` was introduced.  GAP 7's original premise
("a PR can land code that breaks stable consumers") cannot occur
because the workspace has *no* stable consumers — it doesn't
compile on stable at all.

**Resolution (2026-05-18, refs issue #267)**:

- `[workspace.package].rust-version` claim **dropped**.
- `msrv` / `check-incompatible-msrv-in-tests` removed from `clippy.toml`.
- `tier-2.yml::msrv` **job removed**; its position is held by a
  rationale comment citing #267 for archaeology.
- `uffs-manifest-audit` invariant 3.4 (`rust-version` consistency)
  **retired**.
- `rust-toolchain.toml` is the single source of truth for the
  required toolchain (pinned nightly).

**Forward-looking path**: If a publishable-leaf crate (`uffs-time`,
`uffs-text`, `uffs-broker-protocol`) ever needs MSRV verification
independent of the polars-bound graph, that should be a per-crate
`[package.rust-version]` claim + a focused
`cargo +stable check -p <crate> --locked` CI job — do NOT
resurrect the workspace-wide claim.  GAP 7 will be re-classified
as "OPEN (leaf-only)" only if and when that becomes a real need.

### 4.8 GAP 8 — Fuzz harness exists but never runs (✅ CLOSED 2026-05-12)

**Evidence**: `crates/uffs-mft/fuzz/fuzz_targets/` carries two
real libfuzzer-sys harnesses:

- `fuzz_apply_fixup.rs` — fuzzes `uffs_mft::parse::apply_fixup`,
  which handles untrusted NTFS Update Sequence Array bytes and is
  security-relevant (malformed fixup data could cause buffer
  overflows in a less-safe implementation).
- `fuzz_parse_record.rs` — fuzzes `uffs_mft::parse::parse_record`,
  the entry point for raw MFT record deserialisation.

Both harnesses are real (not skeletons): they target real public APIs
that process untrusted on-disk bytes.  Both were committed during
the shift-left rollout (mtime 2026-04-24).  But:

- Zero references to `cargo fuzz run` exist in any workflow,
  pre-push hook, or justfile recipe.
- The harnesses produce no corpus, no coverage signal, and no
  artifact stream.
- `§2.2 Four tiers` explicitly lists "fuzz" as a T4 candidate.
  Mutation testing landed in PR #180 (R3-04); fuzz was not
  scheduled and was forgotten.

This is orphaned security-relevant infrastructure: code exists and
compiles, but rots silently with every change to the underlying APIs.

**Class of bugs this misses**: Bytes-in-buffer panics, integer
overflows on malformed metadata fields, slice-bounds violations on
truncated records, infinite loops on cyclical record references.
Exactly the bug classes Miri and cargo-careful *can't* catch —
those tools harden the *known* test inputs; fuzz harnesses
generate adversarial *unknown* inputs.

**Why this gap exists**: Same answer as GAP 7 — the harnesses
were built during the security hardening sprint but the recurring-
schedule work was deprioritised.  The audit trail in the harnesses
themselves (`// Run with: cargo +nightly fuzz run fuzz_apply_fixup`)
suggests they were intended to be run manually, then evolve into
automation.  The manual-run phase never produced a corpus seed
commit, so any new contributor opening the repo today wouldn't
know the harnesses were ever exercised.

**Resolution**: Closed 2026-05-12 via R3-07 (PR landing this entry).
The weekly `fuzz` job sits in `tier-2.yml` between `msrv` and
`tier-2-summary`:

```yaml
fuzz:
  name: Tier 2 / cargo-fuzz (uffs-mft)
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest

          crates/uffs-mft/fuzz/corpus/
        retention-days: 90
```

**Advisory rollout** (same posture as `cargo-mutants`): the
harnesses have been committed since 2026-04-24 but have never run.
No corpus seed exists, so the first run starts from zero coverage
and may find immediate crashes from uninitialised edge cases the
existing test suite doesn't reach.  `continue-on-error: true` plus
deliberate omission from `tier-2-summary`'s required-set check and
from `notify-failure.needs` mean those crashes surface in the
weekly summary + artifact upload without blocking the workflow.
Once a corpus baseline is established and known crashes are triaged
(either fixed or marked as expected via `crashes/` filtering), a
follow-up PR can promote to hard-fail-on-regression.

**Time-budget choice**: `-max_total_time=900` (15 min per target)
keeps the wall-clock predictable.  A run-count budget (`-runs=N`)
would vary wildly based on how quickly libfuzzer finds new
coverage — fast on day 1 (no corpus), slow on day 30 (saturated
corpus).

**Long-term**: persist the corpus across runs via `actions/cache`
with a corpus-versioned key so each weekly run builds on the last
instead of restarting from zero coverage.  GitHub OSS-Fuzz
integration is the next tier beyond that if the project scales to
that point.

## 5. Known Bugs in the Current Flow

### 5.1 BUG A — `just ship` resumable state skips `git push` after success (✅ CLOSED 2026-04-23)

**Observed**: 2026-04-22, during v0.5.71 release.

1. First `just ship -v` run: pushed HEAD (`17022992a`) to
   `release/v0.5.71` at 21:20:18.  Step 11-git-push marked `completed`
   in `build/.uffs-workflow-state.json`.
2. CI on that HEAD failed `cargo vet`.
3. Committed audit fix `185ed8825` locally at 21:29:36.
4. Re-ran `just ship -v`.  The pipeline loaded cached state, saw every
   step marked `completed`, exited in 2 s.  **Step 11 silently skipped
   even though HEAD was 1 commit ahead of `origin/release/v0.5.71`.**
5. Had to bypass with a direct
   `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 git push origin 185ed8825:refs/heads/release/v0.5.71`
   to land the audit.

**Root cause**: `execute_step_with_tracking` in
`scripts/ci/ci-pipeline.rs` around line 1341 checks *only* whether the step
name is in the completed-set, not whether the underlying condition still
holds (HEAD == already-pushed-ref).

**Fix pattern**:

```rust
// Step 11 entry — before checking cached state:
let unpushed = Command::new("git")
    .args(["rev-list", "--count",
           &format!("origin/{}..HEAD", release_branch)])
    .output()
    .await?;
let n: u64 = std::str::from_utf8(&unpushed.stdout)?.trim().parse()?;
if n > 0 {
    state.invalidate_step(STEP_GIT_PUSH);
}
```

**Resolution**: Closed 2026-04-23 via PR #45 — Phase 3 of §6 below.
Implemented as `count_unpushed_commits` in
`scripts/ci-pipeline/src/git_ops.rs:71–86`, invoked by
`scripts/ci-pipeline/src/ship.rs:346–355` immediately before the
resumable-state machinery picks up step 11.  Source comments at
both sites cite `dev-flow-implementation-plan.md § 6.3` (the
implementation-plan companion to this doc's §6.3) so the fix is
self-referencing and bisection-friendly.  Handles the first-push
edge case (`origin/<branch>` does not yet exist) as the proposed
fix specified: `git rev-list` fails, the helper folds that into
`Ok(1)`, and the push runs.

### 5.2 BUG B — `CARGO_INCREMENTAL` vs sccache drift (✅ CLOSED 2026-04-24)

**Observed**: same release, same day.  pre-push hook failed with
`sccache: incremental compilation is prohibited: Unset CARGO_INCREMENTAL
to continue.`

**Root cause**: two unrelated configs set conflicting policies:

- `.cargo/config.toml:24` — `rustc-wrapper = "sccache"` (applies globally).
- `just/shared.just:15` — `export CARGO_INCREMENTAL := "1"` (exported into
  every `just` recipe's environment).

sccache refuses to wrap rustc when `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=1` because
incremental artifacts are non-cacheable (sccache source:
`src/compiler/rust.rs`).  When `just ship` spawned `git push`, the
pre-push hook inherited `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=1` from the just env, and
every cargo-invoking gate (rustdoc, deny, nextest) died.

**Resolution**: Closed 2026-04-24 via PR #52 ("fix(preview): complete
Phase 5 re-bake — windows-latest move + RC_PATH fix") — Phase 4 of
§6 below.  The drift between `shared.just` and `.cargo/config.toml`
is now eliminated at the root by pairing both settings in one place:

- `.cargo/config.toml::[build]` carries both `rustc-wrapper =
  "sccache"` *and* `incremental = false` together, with a comment
  explicitly referencing "Bug B in docs/architecture/dev-flow.md
  § 5.2" so any future contributor reading the config sees the
  history.
- `just/shared.just` line 15 region carries a `# CARGO_INCREMENTAL is
  deliberately NOT exported here` comment that points at the same
  config-owns-cache-policy invariant, again citing Bug B and the
  implementation-plan § 2.1.

Result: every cargo invocation — from `just`, from `git` hooks, from
`rust-script`, from IDE plugins — inherits both settings as one
atomic config.  The workaround in the pipeline's `global_env`
(commit `420e82387`) was kept as defence-in-depth but is no longer
the load-bearing fix.

### 5.3 BUG C — `rust-script` serves stale binary cache (✅ CLOSED 2026-04-23)

**Observed**: same release.  My ci-pipeline.rs fix appeared to have no
effect through several attempts because rust-script's binary cache under
`~/Library/Caches/rust-script/binaries/release/` had 10+ stale compiled
versions of `ci-pipeline.rs` and was picking up a pre-fix one.

**Detection**: Added a
`[ci-pipeline][sccache-fix]` diagnostic eprintln to the source.  If the
line appeared in output, the binary was fresh.  If absent, stale cache.

**Fix**: Two options documented under § 6.5.

**Resolution**: Closed 2026-04-23 via PR #45 — Phase 5B of §6 below.
`scripts/ci/ci-pipeline.rs` was promoted to a real cargo binary at
`scripts/ci-pipeline/Cargo.toml` + `scripts/ci-pipeline/src/main.rs`.
The rust-script execution path is gone; `just` recipes that used to
`rust-script scripts/ci/ci-pipeline.rs` now invoke `cargo run -q
--release -p uffs-ci-pipeline -- <command>` (see
`just/workflow.just::workflow-resume`).  Heisenbug class eliminated:
there is no longer a per-script binary cache to go stale.  Phase 5A
(`rust-script --clear-cache` band-aid) was deliberately *not*
adopted in favour of the structural fix.

Five phases, ordered by risk × reward.  Each phase is a single atomic
commit.

### 6.1 Phase 1 — shift `cargo vet` to pre-push (Commit 1)

**Goal**: Close Gap 1.  Never again submit a PR that fails `cargo vet`.

**Files touched**: `scripts/hooks/_lint_pre_push.sh` only.

**Diff**:

```

**Test plan**:

1. `cargo vet check --locked` — confirm passes on current HEAD.
2. `just lint-pre-push` — the new `vet` gate appears in the per-job grid.
3. Introduce a deliberate failure (e.g. transient exemption removal),
   confirm pre-push aborts.

**Runtime cost**: 1–2 s.  Pre-push budget stays under 60 s warm.

**Risk**: Zero.  Soft-skip pattern matches `typos` / `reuse`.

### 6.2 Phase 2 — add doc tests to pre-push (Commit 2)

**Goal**: Close Gap 3.  Never merge a PR with broken `/// ```rust` blocks.

**Diff**:

```diff
@@ -95,6 +95,8 @@ spawn "lint-ci"      just lint-ci

```

**Test plan**: Add a deliberately-failing doctest, confirm pre-push aborts
with `doc-tests` in the failed list.

**Runtime cost**: 10–30 s warm.  Total pre-push budget moves from 45 s to
~60 s — still within the flow threshold.

**Risk**: Low.  Pre-push may need 1 tick more time.  Nextest timing under
`--no-run` + cargo-doc overlap should amortize.

### 6.3 Phase 3 — fix ship resumable push-skip bug (Commit 3)

**Goal**: Close Bug A.  `just ship` re-run after a local commit always
pushes the new HEAD.

**Files touched**: `scripts/ci/ci-pipeline.rs`.

**Patch target** (around line 1341, at start of step 11 execution):

```rust
// Invariant: a push step is only "complete" if origin is at HEAD.
// If the developer has committed locally since the prior push (e.g.
// to fix a CI-detected issue such as a cargo-vet audit), the cached
// state would otherwise skip the push silently.  Re-run unconditionally
// whenever HEAD is ahead of the target remote ref.
let n_unpushed = count_unpushed_commits(&release_branch).await?;
if n_unpushed > 0 {
    println!(
        "↻ {} unpushed commit(s) on HEAD — re-running step 11",
        n_unpushed.to_string().yellow()
    );
    state.invalidate_step(STEP_GIT_PUSH);
}

execute_step_with_tracking(state, STEP_GIT_PUSH, || async {
    // ... existing push logic
}).await?;
```

Plus one helper:

```rust
async fn count_unpushed_commits(remote_branch: &str) -> Result<u64> {
    let out = Command::new("git")
        .args(["rev-list", "--count",
               &format!("origin/{}..HEAD", remote_branch)])
        .output()
        .await?;
    if !out.status.success() {
        // Remote branch doesn't exist yet — push creates it.
        return Ok(1);
    }
    Ok(std::str::from_utf8(&out.stdout)?.trim().parse().unwrap_or(1))
}
```

**Test plan**: reproduce the v0.5.71 sequence.  Run ship, let it push,
then add a commit, re-run ship.  Before fix: exits in 2 s without
pushing.  After fix: re-runs step 11, push lands new HEAD.

**Risk**: Low.  The `git rev-list` check is read-only; the invalidation is
targeted to step 11 only.

### 6.4 Phase 4 — resolve `CARGO_INCREMENTAL` vs sccache drift (Commit 4)

**Goal**: Close Bug B at root.  One authority decides the local cache
policy; no more surprises when a pipeline inherits the "wrong" one.

**Options compared**:

| Option | Change | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A** — flip `shared.just` to `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0` | `just/shared.just:15` | sccache covers nearly everything incremental would; one source of truth; matches CI env | First cold compile slightly slower (~5–10 %) |
| **B** — remove `rustc-wrapper` from `.cargo/config.toml`, enable sccache only in `ci-pipeline.rs` | `.cargo/config.toml:24` | Keeps local `cargo build` feeling snappy with incremental | sccache benefit lost for daily `cargo build`/test; defeats its purpose |
| **C** — keep the pipeline-level pairing (status quo) | none | Zero code change | Drift remains; the sccache server env-caching bug lurks |

**Recommendation**: **Option A**.  At UFFS workspace size (polars-heavy,
~700 dependent crates resolved), sccache-warm is consistently faster than
incremental-warm because incremental only helps crates you just edited,
while sccache hits across the entire graph.  Benchmarked on this machine:

- sccache-warm, `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0`, `cargo build --workspace`:
  ~42 s after touching one file in `uffs-core`.
- sccache-off, `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=1`: ~68 s same scenario.

```

And simplify `scripts/ci/ci-pipeline.rs` (remove the now-redundant
workaround):

```diff
-        // sccache refuses to wrap rustc when CARGO_INCREMENTAL=1 ...
-        let sccache_available = !no_sccache && command_exists("sccache");
-        if sccache_available {
-            global_env.push(("RUSTC_WRAPPER".into(), "sccache".into()));
-            global_env.push(("CARGO_INCREMENTAL".into(), "0".into()));
-            if verbose { eprintln!("[ci-pipeline][sccache-fix] ..."); }
-        }

+        if sccache_available {
+            global_env.push(("RUSTC_WRAPPER".into(), "sccache".into()));
+        }
```

**Test plan**:

1. Fresh clone + `cargo build --workspace` cold — record time.
2. Touch one file + rebuild — record time.  Should match the ~42 s above.
3. `just ship -v` through to push.  Pre-push hook all green.
4. Run a direct `git push` from shell with no env overrides.  Pre-push
   hook all green (proof that the drift is gone).

**Risk**: **Medium**.  Any `just` recipe that silently assumed
incremental compilation may feel slightly different.  Rollback is a
one-line revert.

### 6.5 Phase 5 — eliminate `rust-script` stale cache (Commit 5, optional)

**Goal**: Close Bug C.  Make `ci-pipeline.rs` changes take effect on the
next `just ship` unconditionally.

**Two approaches**:

#### 6.5.A — add `rust-script --clear-cache` to `ship-fresh`

Trivial one-line addition to `just/workflow.just:79`:

```diff
 ship-fresh *ARGS:
     @printf "..."
+    @rust-script --clear-cache >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
     rust-script scripts/ci/ci-pipeline.rs ship --fresh {{ ARGS }}
```

Pros: zero restructuring.
Cons: blows 3.7 GB of rust-script cache on every ship-fresh — other
scripts recompile too.  Catastrophic if multiple scripts.

#### 6.5.B — promote `ci-pipeline.rs` to a real cargo binary (RECOMMENDED)

Move `scripts/ci/ci-pipeline.rs` → `scripts/ci-pipeline/src/main.rs`
with a dedicated `scripts/ci-pipeline/Cargo.toml`.  Add to workspace
`members` so `cargo build -p ci-pipeline` compiles it like any other
crate.

```diff
 # Cargo.toml (workspace)
 [workspace]
 members = [
     "crates/uffs-broker",
     ...
+    "scripts/ci-pipeline",
 ]
```

Then `just/workflow.just`:

```diff
 ship *ARGS:
-    rust-script scripts/ci/ci-pipeline.rs ship {{ ARGS }}
+    cargo run --release -p ci-pipeline -- ship {{ ARGS }}
```

Pros: standard cargo fingerprinting catches source changes; no cache
ambiguity; ci-pipeline can use workspace dependencies cleanly;
`cargo check` in IDE picks it up.
Cons: Changes the ship invocation string (muscle memory), requires one
compile during `just ship` if source changed (seconds).

**Recommendation**: 6.5.B.  Cost: ~30 min of restructuring + updating the
docstrings.  Eliminates an entire class of Heisenbugs.

## 7. Post-Refactor Budget Targets

| Tier | Before | After | Change |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| T1 pre-commit | 15–25 s | 15–25 s | none |
| T2 pre-push | 23–45 s | 35–60 s | +12–15 s (`cargo vet` + doc tests) |
| T3 Tier 1 CI | 8–12 min | 8–12 min | none |
| T4 Tier 2 CI | 60–90 min | 60–90 min | none |

Post-refactor pre-push budget is still within the "developer flow"
threshold (&lt; 60 s ideal, &lt; 90 s tolerable).  The additional work is
strictly more caught-locally bugs.

---

## 8. Non-Goals (intentionally NOT changing)

- **Not running the full test suite at pre-push.**  2–3 min is too
  long.  Keep `--no-run` plus add `--doc` (Phase 2).
- **Not shifting CodeQL left.**  Wrong layer; 400 MB download.
- **Not shifting coverage / miri / udeps left.**  Minutes-scale.
  `cargo machete` is a fast alternative for udeps's subset, deferred to
  a future Phase 6 if needed.
- **Not duplicating CI gates at pre-push out of paranoia.**  Clippy at
  both pre-commit AND pre-push is intentional defense-in-depth for
  `--no-verify` bypass; other duplication would be noise.
- **Not removing the existing exemption-based `cargo vet` entries.**
  388 exemptions is the established posture for a small-team repo;
  wholesale auditing every transitive dep is a 100+ hour project.
  Keep the current mix: real audits for new crates (per the "no
  suppression hacks" rule applied to new deps), exemptions grandfathered
  for established ecosystem crates.

---

## 9. Industry Comparison

Surveyed pre-commit / pre-push posture of public Rust repos (sourced
from each repo's `.pre-commit-config.yaml` / `Makefile.toml` /
`scripts/hooks/`):

| Repo | pre-commit | pre-push | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **tokio** | fmt + clippy + typos | none | Heavy CI; devs run `cargo test` manually. |
| **rustls** | fmt only | none | Minimal local; heavy CI. |
| **polars** | ruff + black + minimal Rust | none | Mixed Python/Rust project. |
| **clap** | fmt + clippy | none | Heavy CI matrix. |
| **bytes** | fmt | none | Tiny; CI-heavy. |
| **UFFS (current, post-W5/L1)** | clippy trio + file-size + typos + reuse + taplo | clippy trio + rustdoc + doctests + deny + test-compile + smoke + **xwin clippy (`lint-ci-windows`)** + cargo-vet (when dep-changed) + commit-subjects + file-size + typos + reuse | Deeper local gates than any above; pre-push now strict-lints Windows-gated code via cargo-xwin clippy. |
| **UFFS (initial baseline, 2025)** | clippy trio + xwin + file-size + typos + reuse + taplo | clippy trio + rustdoc + deny + test-compile + xwin + file-size + typos + reuse | Pre-Phase-2 baseline kept here for historical reference — xwin lived at pre-commit and was a compile-only check. |

**Takeaway**: UFFS is already ahead of typical Rust OSS posture on local
coverage.  The shift-left work here is about closing two specific holes,
not adopting a new philosophy.

## 10. Execution Plan (commits, ranked)

| # | Title | Phase | Effort | Risk | ROI |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `shift-left(pre-push): cargo vet check --locked` | § 6.1 | 5 min | zero | **highest** — prevents today's exact failure class |
| 2 | `shift-left(pre-push): cargo test --doc` | § 6.2 | 5 min | low | high |
| 3 | `fix(ship): invalidate git-push step when HEAD is ahead of origin` | § 6.3 | 30 min | low | high — removes v0.5.71-class pain |
| 4 | `fix(shared.just): CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 to match sccache config` | § 6.4 | 15 min + validation | medium | medium — root-causes Bug B |
| 5 | `refactor(scripts): promote ci-pipeline.rs to a workspace binary` | § 6.5.B | 90 min | medium | medium — eliminates Heisenbug class |

Commits 1 + 2 + 3 together form the "fast pass" — ~45 min of
surgery, addresses the three highest-pain items from the v0.5.71
retrospective.

---

## 11. Open Questions

- **Should `cargo machete` join pre-push?**  ~200 ms cost, catches
  Dependabot-orphan deps.  Defer until after Commits 1–3 land and we see
  whether the existing pre-push is already painful enough.
- **Should pre-push grow a `--fast` mode?**  `just lint-pre-push-fast`
  that skips the clippy trio on the grounds that pre-commit already ran
  them?  Probably not — `--no-verify` bypass makes the backstop
  worthwhile.
- **Windows pre-push parity.**  The Unix `scripts/hooks/pre-push` + shell
  script pattern doesn't extend cleanly to Windows.  Today Windows
  contributors implicitly rely on CI.  Acceptable while maintainer is
  the primary Windows user, reassess if contributor base grows.
